## Key Project Context

### 1. This is THREE Projects Merged Into One
Based on our Gavel database review, this site combines:
- **Project 6844**: Personal branding website (original)

- **Monthly**: AI debate format on hot auction topics
- **Ad-hoc**: Manual blog posts (like the Elting Morison book review)

### 3. Intelligence System Architecture
The database already has tables for:
- `IntelligenceItem` - News and data collection

## Quick Start for AI Agents

To work on this project:

1. **Always use the existing schema** - Don't create new tables, use what's there
2. **Single Database Setup** - Local and production use same Railway database
3. **Use Prisma Studio** - `npx prisma studio` to view/edit data
4. **Start dev server** - Just `npm run dev` (no Docker needed)
5. **Small PRs** - Make focused changes that can be reviewed easily

### âœ… Blog System Now Live
- **Admin Interface**: `/admin/content` with "Blog Posts" tab
- **Create Posts**: `/admin/content/new-post`
- **Edit Posts**: `/admin/content/edit/[id]`
- **API Routes**: `/api/blog` for CRUD operations
- **Public Blog**: `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]` pages

## Content Examples Needed

### Blog Post Ideas
1. "Why Organizations Resist Innovation: Lessons from Naval Gunnery" (Elting Morison book)
2. Daily auction industry news with commentary
3. Weekly AI analysis of auction trends
4. Case studies from successful auctions

### Project Portfolio Items
1. Gavel v2 - Auction Management Platform
2. McLemore Auction Company - Digital transformation
3. Auction industry speaking engagements
4. Open source contributions

## Integration Points

### With Gavel v2
- Could showcase Gavel as a major project
- Use Gavel's press release system for content ideas
- Cross-promote between platforms

### With McLemore Auction
- Highlight successful auction case studies
- Link to current auctions
- Showcase expertise through real examples

## Notes for Will

1. **The foundation is solid** - The hard part (infrastructure, deployment, schema) is done
2. **Focus on content first** - Get real projects and blog posts in to make it valuable
3. **Automation can wait** - Manual posting works fine initially
4. **The Intelligence System is powerful** - When activated, it will differentiate your site

## Common Commands

```bash
# Local development (simplified - no Docker needed!)
cd /Users/willmclemore/wills_code/willmclemore.com
npm run dev

# Database management
npx prisma studio                # View/edit data in browser
npx prisma migrate dev          # Apply schema changes
npx prisma db push              # Push schema without migration

# Blog management
# Visit /admin/content in browser for full blog management UI

# Deploy (automatic via Railway)
git push origin main

# View production logs
railway logs
```

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Why Railway over Vercel?** - Full-stack support with PostgreSQL
2. **Why Prisma?** - Type-safe database access with great DX
3. **Why not MDX files?** - Database allows dynamic content and automation
4. **Why Intelligence System?** - Differentiator for thought leadership

Remember: This site is not just a portfolio - it's a platform for establishing thought leadership in the auction industry through automated, AI-enhanced content creation.
