# Introduction to Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a powerful way to add metadata to your blog posts. It's written in YAML format at the beginning of your markdown or MDX files, separated by triple dashes.

## Benefits of Using Frontmatter

1. **Structured Metadata**: Keep all your post metadata in one place
2. **SEO Optimization**: Easily manage SEO titles and descriptions
3. **Content Organization**: Use tags and categories to organize your content
4. **Flexibility**: Add custom fields as needed

## Example Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-17"
tags: 
  - "tag1"
  - "tag2"
featured: true
---
```

## How It Works in This Blog

When you create a blog post with frontmatter:

1. The system automatically extracts the metadata
2. The frontmatter values override any form fields
3. The content below the frontmatter is rendered as MDX

### Custom Components

You can use React components in your MDX content:

<div className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  <p className="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
    This is a custom styled div component inside MDX!
  </p>
</div>

### Code Highlighting

```javascript
// Syntax highlighting works out of the box
function extractFrontmatter(content) {
  const { data, content: mdxContent } = matter(content)
  return {
    metadata: data,
    content: mdxContent
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always include a title in your frontmatter
- Use ISO date format for dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Keep tags lowercase and hyphenated
- Add SEO metadata for better search visibility

## Conclusion

Frontmatter makes content management much easier by separating metadata from content. It's especially useful when:

- Managing multiple blog posts
- Implementing SEO best practices
- Organizing content with tags and categories
- Adding custom metadata fields
